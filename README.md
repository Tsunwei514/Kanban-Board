# Kanban Board with JWT Authentication

## Description

This Kanban board application integrates authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to the board. Users are required to log in using a secure login page, after which they are authenticated using JWT, allowing them to access and manage tasks. The session is securely managed, and JWTs are stored in local storage for subsequent authenticated requests. This project includes a fully functional login page, Kanban board functionality, and JWT authentication implementation.
